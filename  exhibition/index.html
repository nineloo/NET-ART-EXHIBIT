        This exhibit is about materializing my own fascinations around blackness and its lack of visibility in net art. A sub-genre sunken into Vimeo pages and Tumblr threads. I want to not only showcase these selected artworks, but I am hoping that this will get us to think about the pieces that aren’t made so accessible to net artwork databases. This exhibit is meant to display of the unprescribed appearances of black art, the visuals that are not as well noticed or acknowledged enough of the time. With visuals that refrain from being modeled in a concise and direct call to action. Ones that require us to look, revisit, and still not understand. There are so many perspectives and voices, but it always baffles me how black artists are expected to encapsulate their work around guided formulas. Their works must push the brink by touching the painfully dragged out ‘black experience’. A phrase that doesn’t truly coincide with reality. My goal with this exhibit is to showcase the impossibilities in there being one voice or collective experience of blackness. My hope for this exhibit is to bring to the surface how there are so many mediums to black art; not solely in where the artists devote their concentration. This is about the identities, styles and practices that can’t settle as plastic replicated messages. Here, works radiating the unusual are the blueprint. All the artworks I have arranged to be shown were created in the twenty-first century with black artists behind every piece.
